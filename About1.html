    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>
        Your Memories, Together.
        At Memoria, we believe that memories are meant to be shared. That’s why we created the Shared Album — a special place where you and your loved ones can come together to collect, design, and preserve your most meaningful moments. Whether it’s a family trip, a friendship journey, or a celebration of milestones, our album lets each person add their favorite pictures, notes, and little touches.
        
        Easy to personalize and even easier to love — choose themes, add messages, and design each page as a reflection of your story. The best part? Everyone contributes, making the album a beautiful blend of different hearts and memories. It’s more than just photos. It’s a shared experience, captured forever.
        
        Start your shared album today — and turn every memory into a page worth keeping.
