        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Create Your Album:</strong> Start by giving your memory album a name — maybe it's a birthday, a wedding, or just a fun hangout with friends. With one simple click, your private digital album is ready to capture every special moment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Invite Your People:</strong> Once your album is ready, you’ll get a unique private code. Share it with anyone you want — no sign-up needed — anyone with the code can join and start uploading their memories!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Upload from Any Device:</strong> Whether you're using a phone, tablet, or computer, uploading photos is quick and easy. Everyone can add their best moments to the album — anytime, anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Relive the Moments:</strong> Watch your album grow as each photo is added. Flip through your shared collection, laugh at the memories, and download your favorite shots. It’s like building a digital scrapbook — together.
